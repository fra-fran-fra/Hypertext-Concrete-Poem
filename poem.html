        <p>Do not stand at my grave and weep

            I am not there. I do not sleep.
            
            I am a <a href="./winds.html">thousand winds</a> that blow.
            
            I am the diamond glints on snow.
            
            I am the sunlight on ripened grain.
            
            I am the gentle autumn rain.
            
            When you awaken in the morningâ€™s hush
            
            I am the swift uplifting rush
            
            Of quiet birds in circled flight.
            
            I am the soft stars that shine at night.
            
            Do not stand at my grave and cry;
            
            I am not there. I did not die.</p>
