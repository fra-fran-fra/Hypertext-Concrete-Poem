        <p>Do not stand at my grave and weep<br>

            I am not there. I do not sleep.<br>
            
            I am a <a href="./winds.html">thousand winds</a> that blow.<br>
            
            I am the diamond glints on snow.<br>
            
            I am the sunlight on ripened grain.<br>
            
            I am the gentle autumn rain.<br>
            
            When you awaken in the morningâ€™s hush<br>
            
            I am the swift uplifting rush<br>
            
            Of quiet birds in circled flight.<br>
            
            I am the soft stars that shine at night.<br>
            
            Do not stand at my grave and cry;<br>
            
            I am not there. I did not die.</p>
